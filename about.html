                    <h2>The Roof of the World</h2>
                    <p>Tibet, often called "The Roof of the World," sits on the Tibetan Plateau, the highest region on Earth with an average elevation exceeding 4,500 meters (14,800 ft). This vast plateau, surrounded by imposing mountain ranges including the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Kunlun, has shaped a unique culture adapted to life at extreme altitudes.</p>
                    <p>With its breathtaking landscapes ranging from towering peaks to sacred lakes, vast grasslands to remote valleys, Tibet offers some of the most spectacular natural scenery on the planet. The region's isolation has helped preserve its distinct cultural identity despite centuries of change.</p>

                    <p>Tibetan culture is deeply intertwined with Tibetan Buddhism, which has influenced every aspect of traditional life. Monasteries have historically served not only as religious centers but also as seats of learning, art, and governance.</p>
                    <p>The artistic traditions of Tibet are renowned worldwide, from intricate thangka paintings and sand mandalas to distinctive architecture and sculpture. Music, dance, and festivals play an important role in Tibetan life, with events like Losar (Tibetan New Year) and various monastery festivals drawing participants from across the region.</p>
                    <p>Tibetan literature includes a vast collection of Buddhist texts as well as epic poetry, folk tales, and songs that have been passed down through generations.</p>

                    <h2>The Tibetan People</h2>
                    <p>The Tibetan people have developed remarkable adaptations to high-altitude living, with genetic and physiological traits that allow them to thrive in an environment where oxygen is scarce. Their traditional lifestyle has been shaped by the harsh environment, with nomadic herding and high-altitude farming as historical mainstays.</p>
                    <p>Tibetan hospitality is legendary. Despite the challenging environment, Tibetans are known for their warmth, generosity, and resilience. Traditional values emphasize compassion, mindfulness, and harmony with nature.</p>
                    <p>Today, while preserving their rich heritage, Tibetans are also engaging with modernity. Urban centers like Lhasa blend ancient traditions with contemporary developments, creating a fascinating cultural landscape in transition.</p>

                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Altitude Awareness</h3>
                    <p>Tibet's high elevation requires proper acclimatization. Most visitors experience some degree of altitude adjustment, which can include symptoms like headache, fatigue, or shortness of breath. We design our itineraries with gradual ascent profiles and adequate rest days to minimize altitude-related issues. Our guides are trained to monitor and respond to altitude concerns.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Travel Regulations</h3>
                    <p>Travel to Tibet requires specific permits for foreign visitors, and these regulations can change. All travelers must be part of an organized tour with a licensed guide. Independent travel is not permitted for foreign visitors. Our team handles all necessary paperwork and stays updated on the latest requirements to ensure a smooth journey.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Cultural Respect</h3>
                    <p>Tibet's culture is deeply spiritual, and visitors should approach religious sites and customs with appropriate respect. This includes walking clockwise around religious structures, asking permission before photographing people, dressing modestly when visiting monasteries, and being mindful of local traditions. Our guides provide cultural orientation to help you navigate these customs respectfully.</p>
