## Directory Structure
```
/
├── index.html
├── destinations.html
├── services.html
├── about.html
├── contact.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── js/
│   └── main.js
└── images/
    ├── logo-placeholder.svg
    ├── backgrounds/
    │   └── (background images)
    ├── destinations/

    ├── testimonials/
    │   └── (testimonial profile images)
    └── team/
        └── (team and cultural images)
```

## Image Structure
The images are organized in a maintainable directory structure:

1. **logo-placeholder.svg** - Company logo in SVG format
2. **backgrounds/** - Contains large background images like hero banners and section backgrounds
3. **destinations/** - Contains all destination-specific images
4. **testimonials/** - Contains profile images for testimonials
5. **team/** - Contains team photos and cultural images

Each directory contains a placeholder.txt file with information about the expected images. For development purposes, background colors have been added to image elements to ensure the layout looks good even before all images are added.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a blog section for travel tips and stories
- Create a photo gallery showcasing Tibet's beauty
- Add multilingual support for international visitors
- Integrate with social media platforms
